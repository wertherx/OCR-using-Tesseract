# OCR-using-Tesseract

I created this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software using Tesseract and OpenCV

The program is pretty straightforward but was a good exposure to practial applications of programming and using libraries in python

To run the program you will need to pip install Tesseract and OpenCV libraries and do some basic configuration. The sample images are avaliable to test your OCR
